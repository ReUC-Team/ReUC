This ownership grants exclusive rights to perform major lifecycle transitions, such as **Starting** the project or performing a **Rollback**.\n\n**Business Rules Checked:**\n- **Single Type Cardinality:** Ensures that exactly **one** Project Type ID is selected for the project, normalizing the input if necessary.\n- **Time Constraints:** Validates that the provided `deadline` fits within the *minimum* and *maximum* estimated months defined by the selected Project Type configuration.\n    - *Note:* A **30-day margin of error** is applied to this calculation to allow for reasonable flexibility.",
